# Python_Project_Term-2_Dynamic_Graphs
Dynamic Graph Project - Air Quality Data Analysis
Overview
This project focuses on the analysis of air quality data in India from 2015 to 2020. The dataset contains day-wise information on various air quality parameters, including PM2.5, PM10, NO, NO2, NOx, NH3, CO, SO2, O3, Benzene, Toluene, Xylene, AQI, and AQI Bucket. The goal is to gain insights into air quality trends, visualize the data dynamically, and share valuable information.

Project Structure
Data Analysis Script (air_quality_analysis.ipynb):
Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for loading, cleaning, and analyzing the air quality dataset.
Dynamic graph creation using matplotlib and plotly libraries.
In-depth exploration of various air quality parameters over the years.
It also contains dynamic graphs and visualizations generated from the analysis.

Graphs and Visualizations:
Examples include time-series plots, distribution histograms, and correlation matrices.

Usage
Open and run the Jupyter Notebook (air_quality_analysis.ipynb) in your local environment.
Follow the step-by-step instructions for data loading, cleaning, and analysis.
Generate dynamic graphs and visualizations by executing the code cells.
Explore the insights derived from the air quality dataset over the specified period.

Results
The project provides a comprehensive analysis of air quality in India, showcasing trends, correlations, and patterns in the dataset. The dynamic graphs offer an interactive way to visualize and interpret the air quality parameters over time.

Future Improvements
Incorporate additional datasets for a more comprehensive analysis.
Implement machine learning models for predictive analytics.
Enhance interactivity in dynamic graphs for user-friendly exploration.
